<![CDATA[
        Because my phone have support for USB-OTG (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">USB On-The-Go</a>), but do not have a quick way to unmount an attached USB device, I made this application.<br/>
        This is an open source application. The sources are available here: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/storage-info/">https://code.google.com/p/storage-info/</a><br/><br/>
        This application will create a shortcut to access the Storage Settings from the Notification bar when an USB mass storage is connected to an Android device which support USB-OTG.<br/>
		Normaly the Storage Settings should be accessbile from your Settings menu.<br/><br/>
		Starting with the version 2.0 is possible to access a quick mounting and unmounting dialog from the Notification bar.<br/>
		If this new feature is crashing, please unplug any USB device attached and uncheck the "Enable quick storage access.".<br/><br/>
		<font color=#cc0029>This application will not</font> add to your device host support, read device manual to see if the device support USB-OTG. In some cases the USB-OTG could be enabled by using a custom ROM.<br/><br/>
		<font color=#cc0029>This application will not always</font> mount back an unmounted USB storage device, that\'s because sometime the Android system is not able to process that request. I made the implementation but is not always successfully.<br/><br/>
		Starting with the version 3.0 is possible to select an application, preferable a file manager, to be launched when a storage is mounted.<br/> 
		If you select a file manager to be launched when a storage is mounted is no guarentee to be displayed the mounted folder, that because is not a standard way to \"notice\" the application to show a particular path. I test with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a>.]]>
